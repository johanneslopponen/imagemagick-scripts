# imagemagick-scripts
Serves as a backup for my scripts.

Feel free to use distribute and add to these scripts.

##### Usage:
- Place the script in the same directory as the images.
- Run chmod +x "name of the script" to make it executable.
- run ./"name of the script" to execute the script.

If you want to convert tiff and or jpg images to [heif](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_Efficiency_Image_File_Format) format, then check out my other repository named [convert-to-heic](https://github.com/johanneslopponen/convert-to-heic).
